Q1:Reverse an Array
Q2:Rotate an Array
Q3:Convert array into Zig-Zag fashion
Given an array of DISTINCT elements, rearrange the 
elements of array in zig-zag fashion in O(n) time. The 
converted array should be in form a < b > c < d > e < f.
Input: arr[] = {4, 3, 7, 8, 6, 2, 1}
Output: arr[] = {3, 7, 4, 8, 2, 6, 1}
Q4:Find the Leader Element in an Array
Q5: Find the Missing Number
You are given a list of n-1 integers and these integers 
are in the range of 1 to n. There are no duplicates in the 
list. One of the integers is missing in the list. Write an 
efficient code to find the missing integer.
Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 4, 6, 3, 7, 8}
Output: 5
Q6:Given an integer array A that contains only integers 0 
and 1. Write a function to sort this array
Sample Input :
7
0 1 1 0 1 0 1
Sample Output :0 0 0 1 1 1 1

Q7:Given an integer array containing only 0s, 1s and 2s. 
Write a solution to sort this array using one scan only.
You need to change in the given array itself. So no need 
to return or print anything.
Input format :
Line 1 : Integer n (Array Size)
Line 2 : Array elements (separated by space)
Sample Input:
7
0 1 2 0 2 0 1
Sample Output:
0 0 0 1 1 2 2
